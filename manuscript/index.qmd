# Abstract

High-accuracy benchmark sets have been fundamental to the Genome in a Bottle
(GIAB) Consortium's success in evaluating and improving sequencing technologies.
However, existing benchmarks are limited by their reliance on short-read mapping
to a single linear reference, omitting complex genomic regions. Here, we present
the Q100 benchmark, a comprehensive variant benchmark derived from a
high-quality, fully phased diploid assembly of the HG002 sample. Our approach
leverages recent advances in long-read sequencing and assembly to provide
confident variant calls across previously inaccessible regions, including
segmental duplications, centromeres, and complex immune loci. The Q100 benchmark
significantly expands the callable genome, adding \~300 Mbp of sequence and
increasing variant detection by 16% for small variants and 3-fold for structural
variants compared to previous benchmarks. We demonstrate the utility of this
resource by evaluating multiple sequencing technologies and variant calling
pipelines, revealing systematic differences in variant detection across genomic
contexts. The Q100 benchmark provides a critical resource for the development
and validation of next-generation sequencing technologies and analysis methods.
