## Results

### DefrABB enables reproducible, assembly-based benchmark generation

- Workflow overview, workout overlap with methods section (Figure {@fig:workflow}).
- run specific configuration
- Development of exclusion heuristics

### Benchmark content and genome coverage

**Use GRCh38 stats in manuscript with GRCh37 and CHM13 in supplemental**

- Variant counts and characteristics
- Benchmark region coverage
- Comparison to previous benchmark set versions
- examples of new or exclcuded regions
  - JZ's vignettes

### External Evaluation and Validation

- Q100 curations, confidence in assembly accuracy
- external evaluations: not evaluation of comparison callsets but a validation of the benchmark set
  - small variants
  - structural variants
