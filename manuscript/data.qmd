## Data and Code availability

All benchmark VCFs, BEDs, and auxiliary files are hosted on the GIAB FTP under

```         
https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/data/
AshkenazimTrio/analysis/NIST_HG002_DraftBenchmark_defrabbV0.019-20241113/
```

HG002 Q100 v1.1 assemblies are deposited at NCBI (GCA_018852605.3,
GCA_018852615.3) and mirrored at https://github.com/marbl/hg002 [@english2025].

-   DeFrABB pipeline: https://github.com/usnistgov/defrabb [@defrabbRepo]\
-   Benchmarking utilities (`q100bench`): https://github.com/nhansen/q100bench
    [@q100bench2024]\
-   Snakemake provenance archive: data.nist.gov

### Comparison Statistics

The pipeline generates stratified comparison statistics between benchmark versions, available in the `results/stats/` directory:

-   `*_variants.csv`: Contains counts of shared and unique variants (TP, FP, FN) stratified by genomic context (e.g., Tandem Repeats, Segmental Duplications).
-   `*_regions.csv`: Contains counts of shared and unique callable bases stratified by genomic context.

Analysts can load these CSV files directly into R or Python for downstream analysis and visualization of benchmark improvements.
