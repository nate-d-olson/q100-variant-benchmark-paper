# Analysis

- Lack of potential issue with variant types: only indels and DELs in logs

### benchmark_exclusions.qmd

- WIP - claude: Add upset plot for exclusion region intersections

### benchmarkset_characterization.qmd

- Add variants to the exclusion tables
- Small variant counts breakdown by <15bp , 15 - 49bp
- Look into number and distribution of small intervals (50 - 100bp) in v5q

### benchmark_unique_regions.qmd

- Validate summary outputs against old_only status CSVs
- Add compact figure for v5-only vs previous-only base/variant deltas

### benchmark_interval_size_distributions.qmd

- fix legend collect code

### benchmark_difficult.qmd

- Appears as though the interval level coverage files are not present, maybe temp?

### Low priority

- more sensible results and log directory structures
- cleanup data_loading script
